# FLS Sumo Code:

## FILES AND HOW TO EDIT THEM:

### [Sumo V2 Final.lmsp](./Sumo%20v2%20Final.lmsp)
Made in Lego's EV3 Classroom App which you can download [here](https://education.lego.com/en-us/downloads/mindstorms-ev3/software), **there is no chromeOS download**, as far as I am aware, so you will need a *Windows or Apple machine*.

**The program is _unfinished_ so it is best to use the [.UF2 file](./lego-CopeV6.uf2)**

### [lego-CopeV6.uf2](./lego-CopeV6.uf2)
Made in [Microsoft's Makecode web application](https://makecode.mindstorms.com/)
Projects are saved in your browsers cache so **Makecode does not require any login**. In order to edit the .uf2 file, you must import the it by clicking the gray *Import* button on the top right corner of your projects list in your [homepage](https://makecode.mindstorms.com/)

## UPLOADING CODE TO YOUR BRICK

### .lmsp files:
Inside your project at the **bottom left corner** should be two buttons, a download icon and a blue play button. Pressing the download icon will simply download the code, but pressing the blue play button will upload the program and **run** it.

### .uf2 files:
By clicking the *download* button on your **Microsoft Makecode project**, it will automatically download a .uf2 file, the compiled version of your code. Plug your EV3 brick into your computer, it should show up as a storage device after a few minutes.
Drag and drop your .uf2 file into the projects folder and the program will automatically run. On your brick, you will need to navigate to the brick_prog folder and select the name of your .uf2 file then **run it once more afterwards so it shows up on your program list**.

* If the brick does not show as a storage device after a few minutes, the firmware on your brick may be outdated. Only bricks on firmware version 1.10E will appear as a storage device to computers. See [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/mindstorms/comments/pcsacu/how_to_install_and_update_firmware_110e_on_an_ev3/) on how to update your firmware.
